# JavaFXRubiksCube3D

Using JavaFX to render a 3D object.

This is an example of how to setup and render a 3D object in JavaFX. This
particular example is an almost _verbatim_ version of the [gist](https://gist.github.com/jperedadnr/28534fcdce605b75382b)
created by [Jos√© Pereda](https://gist.github.com/jperedadnr) in response to
this StackOverflow [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34001900/how-to-render-3d-graphics-properly).

(The few alterations I've made include changing the direction that the mouse drags the cube. The direction in this project just feels more intuitive to me. Also, the image file used as a color palette is included in the project and the name has been changed from "pallete.png" to "palette.png".)

The program is now contained in an [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project.
